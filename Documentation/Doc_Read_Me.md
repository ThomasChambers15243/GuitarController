## How the game works
The game works with an electronic guitar interface into a game in unity. The game has two modes, a free mode and a rhythm mode. The free mode takes the note your playing and generates the note. The other main mode, rhythm, shows you notes to play along to a song. You play the notes along with the song and every time you hit a right note, you get points. If you score below a certain score you lose. You should try to get the highest note possible.
